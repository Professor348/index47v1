__Inter-Integrated Circuit__ or known as I2C (pronounced I squared C) is a communication protocol used to connect sensors to the Control Hub and Expansion Hub in FTC. It uses two wires — SDA (data) and SCL (clock) — and lets you chain multiple sensors on the same bus as long as they have different addresses. Common I2C sensors in FTC include the REV Color Sensor V3, distance sensors, and the built-in IMU (gyroscope) inside the Control Hub. Each hub has 4 I2C ports (bus 0–3). I2C is __slower__ than SPI but easier to wire and supported by more FTC-legal sensors.
