## About

**Index47** was founded in May 2026 by programmers from **FTC Team 13100**, known as the **47 Beavers**, hence the name **"Index47"** was derived. Since then, many contributors outside the team have regularly helped **expand** the project. It was created after observing that much of the FTC community lacks a **centralized** resource for references, acronyms, and commonly used libraries.
